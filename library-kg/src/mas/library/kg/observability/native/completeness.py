"""Trace-vs-KG completeness check for the native events.jsonl path.

Native counterpart of an OTel completeness check: every native event must
be traceable to a KG node, or its ``kind`` must be a documented no-op
(``KIND_TO_CLASS[kind] is None``).

- Interval events (``kind`` matches ``_(start|end)$``) carry ``call_id``;
  coverage means some node's ``callId`` matches.
- Point-in-time / annotation events (routing, context contributions,
  governance, ...) carry no ``call_id``; their node identity is instead a
  deterministic hash of (run_id, agent_id, kind, timestamp, span_id) --
  see core.graph_builder._annotation_id. Coverage is recomputing that same
  id and checking a node exists with it.
- A ``kind`` that maps to ``None`` in KIND_TO_CLASS (or isn't in
  KIND_TO_CLASS at all) is legitimately covered by definition (deliberately
  suppressed / no ontology class) -- UNLESS it isn't in KIND_TO_CLASS at
  all, in which case it's a genuinely unknown kind that strict=False
  processing would have silently dropped, and that IS a real gap.
