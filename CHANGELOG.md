# Changelog

All notable changes to MAS-Lab are documented here. This branch is the
v0.2 release-prep branch after rebasing onto the latest upstream main and
reconciling the release notes with the code and docs currently on that branch.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Output-token limits are configurable through model and infra manifests.
  `on_truncation` supports `ignore`, `warn`, `error`, and bounded `escalate`;
  `--max-tokens N` aliases the agent models `--override` path. Requests omit
  both output-token fields by default, never send both together, and fit a
  configured budget to `context_window`. See
  [Output-token limits](docs/manifests/agent.md#output-token-limits).

### Breaking

- LLM calls no longer send `max_tokens: 2000` implicitly. Without a model,
  infra, or environment value, the server default applies. Set
  `spec.models[].max_tokens` to keep the previous cap. Provider-level cache
  entries recorded with the implicit 2000 no longer match.

### Fixed

- Overlay patches that target one agent of a MAS (`patch.agents.<id>`,
  `$entry`, `$not-entry`, `$all`, `$delegates`) are merged onto the loaded
  Agent YAML. An agency row stays `{id, ref}`. The MAS document is
  not a parking lot for Agent fields (no in-memory `_agent_patches` map,
  no leftover skills/tools/context on the row). Resolving `$op.add`
  against an empty row used to replace the agent's own skills; that drop
  is gone. A base MAS still cannot declare skills (or tools, context, …)
  on an agency row. `spec.models` remains the MAS-level agent-inherited
  attribute.
- `model: any` (or an omitted pin) no longer falls through to package
  `defaults.yaml` (`gpt-4o-mini`). Engine construction raises if nothing
  explicit remains: `spec.models`, MAS default, `experiment.models.main`,
  workspace `config.yaml` `defaults.model`, `--model`, or `MAS_CTL_MODEL`.
  A `scripted_response` agent does not need a pin; it uses SimulatedEngine.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-30 (release candidate)

### Added

#### IOA, MCP, and A2A first

- `library-ioa` is now the home for protocol-first integration work, with
  explicit MCP client/server bridge support, typed tool adaptation, and the
  `mas-mcp` CLI for serving and invoking tools.
- MCP support is treated as an infra concern rather than a rewrite of agent
  logic: the same agent manifest can be paired with distinct infra adapters for
  local execution or remote MCP tool access.
- A2A agent exposure and delegation are supported through the runtime and CLI,
  with `mas-ctl serve --protocol a2a` and the `a2a` client commands for card
  lookup and direct peer messaging.
- `library-skills` provides the agentskills.io-compatible skill layer, with
  swappable execution backends and progressive skill disclosure.

#### HITL and user communication

- First-class human approval gates and user communication contracts are now part
  of the runtime boundary, enabling structured prompts and requests without
  coupling agent logic to a specific UI implementation.
- Runtime and session plumbing now preserve explicit user-facing signal handling
  across tool calls and delegation boundaries, which is a key requirement for
  production-style conversational workflows.

#### Manifest and governance improvements

- `mas-ctl compile` can emit the fully-resolved agent or MAS spec after overlays
  and library substitutions are applied.
- Semantic validation and tighter overlay validation improve manifest safety and
  help catch invalid cross-field references before execution begins.
- Core governance and plugin wiring continue to harden around explicit registry
  declarations rather than implicit environment behavior.

#### Runtime and observability

- LLM traces and execution metadata remain central to the framework and are
  increasingly used to debug delegation, tool routing, and provider-level
  edge cases.
- The runtime continues to harden around provider compatibility, malformed tool
  arguments, and trace fidelity for long-running multi-agent runs.

#### Protocol compliance results

- Official MCP conformance results show `92.9%` of required checks passing for
  revision `2025-11-25` and `98.3%` for the newer, stricter stateless revision
  `2026-07-28`.
- Deterministic A2A testing across JSON-RPC, HTTP+JSON, and gRPC passed `99/99`
  executed requirements, for a `100%` executed-test pass rate. The official TCK
  maps `79.8%` of the specification; `25` requirements were not exercised
  because no corresponding TCK tests currently exist. This is a test coverage
  limitation, not a reported failure of those implementation areas.

#### Docker image and release artifacts

- The GHCR-backed release pipeline now builds and publishes both the UI and
  backend container images for tagged releases via
  `.github/workflows/docker.yml` and `.github/workflows/build-push-ghcr.yaml`.
- Release images are published under `ghcr.io/outshift-open/mas-lab/ui` and
  `ghcr.io/outshift-open/mas-lab/backend`, using a tag scheme derived from the
  release version and commit SHA. This keeps the Docker image in lockstep with
  the package release.
- The release documentation and image references were refreshed after the branch
  rebase so the release notes match the current upstream Docker workflow.

### Changed

- Protocol integration is treated as an infra-layer concern instead of a change
  to agent business logic.
- Runtime control flow continues to separate model selection, tool access, and
  governance policy so the same workflow can run locally or through a protocol
  adapter without rewriting the agent.
- Project tooling and validation now expect explicit registry and manifest
  declarations for optional capabilities, which makes the environment more
  deterministic and easier to audit.
- The release branch was rebased onto the current upstream `main`, and the
  release documentation and Docker release notes were reconciled to match the
  state of the branch at the time of the cut.

### Fixed

- Tool-call recovery, malformed tool handling, empty-result preservation, and
  history-trimming edge cases continue to be corrected in the runtime.
- Manifest resolution and relative-path safety around library refs and overlays
  are validated before execution.
- Runtime traces are now more reliable for delegations and session-scoped
  execution flows.

### Deprecated / Breaking

- `spec.llm` is no longer the preferred configuration surface; model config is
  expected to live in the explicit model-slot structure instead of the legacy
  top-level field.
- Implicit plugin availability is reduced in favor of explicit registry-driven
  registration, so the environment must declare what is required for a run.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-15

Initial public release.

### Added

- Declarative YAML agent and MAS specifications with overlays and runtime
  contracts.
- A stateful runtime with session/task tracking, observability, and governance
  hooks.
- `mas-ctl` commands for chat, validation, and MAS execution.
- Reproducible lab and benchmarking workflows, plus the standard library and
  sample assets.

### Changed

- Established the core contract-driven execution model and the multi-package
  architecture used by the project today.

### Fixed

- Early runtime issues and compatibility gaps were resolved as the initial OSS
  cut moved from prototype to reusable framework primitives.
