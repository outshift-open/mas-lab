# MAS-Lab Release Process

This document describes the repeatable release sequence for MAS-Lab, including
one-time public PyPI setup and the steps repeated for each release.

## Release model

PyPI publication is integrated before a release branch is cut. The order is:

1. Merge release automation and PyPI publication support into `main` before
    cutting the release branch.
2. Configure public PyPI Trusted Publishers for the distributions listed below.
3. Create `release/vX.Y` from the updated `main`.
4. Set all first-party package versions to `X.Y.0` and regenerate `uv.lock`.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE-NOTES.md`, and the release blog post.
6. Run package builds, documentation checks, unit/functional gates, and protocol
   compliance checks.
7. Push the release branch and open a PR or draft PR so GitHub Actions runs on the
   exact release candidate.
8. Merge the release PR into `main`, then create the annotated `vX.Y.0` tag on
    that merged commit and push it. The tag runs independent PyPI and container
    workflows. After both container images build, the container workflow creates
    the GitHub Release with image references, generated notes, and GitHub's
    automatic source archives (zip and tar.gz). PyPI failure does not block it.

The PyPI feature branch must be based on `main`, not on a release branch. The
release branch receives the version bump and release-specific notes. It is not
the branch to tag after the PR has been merged; it can be deleted after merge.

## One-time public PyPI setup

The publication workflow targets only the public PyPI upload service through
`pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`. It does not publish to GitHub Packages
or to a Cisco-internal package index.

### GitHub setup

Create a GitHub Actions environment named `pypi` in
`outshift-open/mas-lab`. Add required reviewers to this environment if package
publication must be manually approved. The workflow grants `id-token: write`
only to the publication job.

### PyPI setup

For each distribution, configure a PyPI Trusted Publisher with:

- owner: `outshift-open`
- repository: `mas-lab`
- workflow: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- environment: `pypi`

Confirm the owner, repository, workflow filename, and environment for every
distribution before tagging. A missing or mismatched publisher produces
`invalid-publisher` and the package upload fails even if the build succeeded.
Trusted Publishers can be configured as pending publishers before the first
upload. No long-lived PyPI API token is required, and no GPG signing key is
required for the upload. PyPI's attestations/provenance features can be enabled
separately if required by the release policy.

The current public distribution set is:

- `mas-runtime`
- `mas-ctl`
- `mas-lab`
- `mas-lab-core`
- `mas-lab-bench`
- `mas-lab-controller`
- `mas-library-standard`
- `mas-library-skills`
- `mas-library-samples`
- `mas-library-lab`
- `mas-library-eval`
- `mas-library-ioa`

The workspace metapackage is not part of the publication matrix. The MCP and
A2A compliance directories under `library-ioa/compliance/` are CI/test assets,
not user-facing distributions, and are never uploaded to PyPI.

## Repeated pre-release checks

Run from the repository root with the feature or release branch's `.venv`:

```bash
uv lock --check
python3 scripts/version_manager.py check
python3 scripts/gen_docs.py --check
git diff --check
```

Build every matrix package from sdist to wheel. This catches packages whose
wheel configuration depends on files that are absent from the source archive:

```bash
for package_path in runtime ctl library-standard library-skills \
  library-samples library-lab library-eval library-ioa \
  lab/components/core lab/components/bench lab/components/controller \
  lab; do
  uv build "$package_path" || exit 1
done
```

The workflow repeats this through `pyproject-build`, then runs `twine check`
before the OIDC upload. A package that fails either build or metadata validation
is not uploaded.

For a pipeline test before release, use `workflow_dispatch` with `publish=false`
(the default) and `bump_type=none`. This builds and uploads artifacts to the
GitHub Actions run without uploading to PyPI. Set `publish=true` to exercise the
OIDC upload manually, selecting the intended release tag as the workflow ref.
A `vX.Y.0` tag also uploads automatically; before Trusted Publishers are
configured, that upload is expected to fail at authentication.

Run the repository gates appropriate to the candidate:

```bash
task verify-unit
task verify-functional
task verify
```

Also verify MCP and A2A compliance reports and run `task docs-build` for the
published documentation site. Docker image publication is tag-driven; run the
container workflow manually on the candidate when a pre-tag image check is
needed. Check that both GHCR packages are publicly visible and anonymously
pullable if the release is intended for public use; an authenticated CI push
alone does not establish public availability.

After pushing the tag, check the container and PyPI workflow results separately.
Confirm that the GitHub Release exists at `/releases/tag/vX.Y.0`, lists the
published image references and workflow run, and offers GitHub's automatic zip
and tar.gz source archives. Python distributions are not attached to the GitHub
Release; verify each intended distribution on PyPI before claiming it is
available. If the container workflow fails, fix its cause and rerun it on the
same tag; if the Release job alone fails, rerun that workflow or create the
GitHub Release manually on the existing tag with accurate artifact status.

## Version and branch rules

- PyPI publication support is merged to `main` before `release/vX.Y` is made.
- Release branches carry the coordinated version in `VERSION` and every
  publishable `pyproject.toml`.
- Do not tag until the release branch has been rebased onto the latest intended
  `main` and the release PR checks have passed. Tag the merged commit on `main`.
- Do not reuse a published `(distribution, version)` pair. PyPI versions are
  immutable.
- Do not move a published release tag to include later fixes. Fix code on a new
  branch from `main` and publish a new patch version (for example `vX.Y.1`).

## Rollback and failure handling

A failed package build or Trusted Publisher configuration blocks the affected
PyPI publication, not the GitHub Release. Correct a missing Trusted Publisher
on PyPI and rerun the package workflow on the existing tag if the built package
is unchanged and its version has not already been uploaded. If a code or package
change is needed, or some distributions already uploaded that version, do not
delete or reuse their version: publish a new coordinated patch version.

Container image publication is independent of PyPI upload success at the
workflow level. Keep the GitHub Release notes accurate about failed or
unavailable artifacts, and update them when publication later succeeds; do not
move the original tag.
