"""governance-binding.schema.yaml validates shape only — no plugin-id enum.

Regression: the schema used to `enum: [sample_governance, sample_governance@v1]`
(plus per-plugin `additionalProperties: false` property schemas), so any
third-party governance plugin — one the plugin registry resolves fine at
runtime — failed strict manifest validation purely because its name wasn't
in this file's hardcoded list.

    test_still_rejects_multi_key_plugin_object: turns out THIS rejection
    doesn't come from the fragment's item-level oneOf[string, object]
    either — validate_file's strict path also runs the plain-Python spec
    parser (mas.ctl.manifest.spec_bindings._parse_gov_plugin_list), which
    independently raises "governance list entries must be str or dict, got
    int" regardless of what the JSON schema says. So this test is real and
    correct about end-to-end behavior, but — like
    test_still_rejects_non_list_governance above — it is NOT the fragment
    doing the rejecting. As far as I can tell, only
    test_still_rejects_multi_key_plugin_object exercises a constraint that
    is genuinely this fragment's own (minProperties/maxProperties: 1 has no
    equivalent check in the parser, which just iterates however many keys
    a dict item has)."""
