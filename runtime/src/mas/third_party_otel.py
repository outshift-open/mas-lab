"""Keep third-party OpenTelemetry instrumentation off unless the user opts in.

MAS Lab emits OTel only through the ``otel`` observability plugin. Recent
a2a-sdk releases turn tracing on whenever ``opentelemetry`` is importable
(default ``OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_A2A_SDK_ENABLED=true``), wrapping async
work in ``start_as_current_span``. Those spans attach/detach contextvars
tokens. When the work finishes on another thread or asyncio task — the A2A
client's thread-pool ``asyncio.run`` bridge does exactly that —
OpenTelemetry logs ``ValueError: Token was created in a different Context``
at ERROR, one full traceback per call (GitHub issue #127).

The flag is read once at import of ``a2a.utils.telemetry``. This module
must run before any ``a2a`` import. Importing it has the pin as a side
effect; ``pin_third_party_otel_off`` is also safe to call explicitly.

This does **not** set ``OTEL_SDK_DISABLED``. That would disable the
first-party ``otel`` plugin. Explicit ``OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_A2A_SDK_ENABLED=true``
in the process environment is left alone (``setdefault``).

Same reasoning, same mechanism, for ``OBSERVE_REALTIME_OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED``:
the ``ioa-observe-sdk`` dependency (see ``mas-library-telemetry``) defaults
this to ``"true"`` when unset upstream. MAS Lab pins it off by default too —
real-time span emission is opt-in, not implied by installing the SDK.

``mas-library-telemetry`` itself declares zero required dependencies (not
even on ``mas-runtime``, where this module lives), so it cannot import this
module — its own ``src/mas/library/telemetry/__init__.py`` carries an
independent copy of just the ``OBSERVE_REALTIME_OBSERVABILITY_ENABLED``
``setdefault`` line for the case where that package is used standalone,
without ``mas-runtime`` ever being imported. If this flag's default or name
ever changes here, update that copy too — it will not pick this one up.
