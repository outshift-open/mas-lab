class InformUserTool(ToolContract):
    """Send the user a non-blocking status/progress update.

    This is a **system tool** that lets agents keep the user informed during
    a long-running or multi-round task (e.g. "still negotiating with Finance",
    "waiting on Salesforce data") without pausing the agent's turn and without
    waiting for a response.

    Unlike `request_human_input`, which blocks the agent's turn until the user
    answers, `inform_user` is fire-and-forget: the tool call returns immediately
    and the agent keeps working.

    **Architecture**:
    - The tool raises an `InformUserSignal`
    - The tool execution layer catches the signal and routes it to a side
      channel (an external `UserIOContract`, or the shared HITL resolver
      registry as a fallback)
    - External systems (e.g. the Webex bot) poll/consume this side channel and
      post the message, without any user response flowing back
    - Works across delegation boundaries, same as `request_human_input`

    Example usage in agent context:
    ```
    You can post a non-blocking status update by calling:
    inform_user(
        message="Still reviewing Acme Corp renewal economics with Finance.",
        involved_agents=["finance-agent"],
    )
    ```
